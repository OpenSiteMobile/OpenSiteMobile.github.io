OpenSiteMobile
==============

Featuring our MobileSiteOS JavaScript mobile website layer.

This repository contains the top level files served by GitHub for our website https://opensitemobile.com. It of coarse does call our MobileSiteOS software, similar to our MobileSiteOS demo. So please refer to https://opensitemobile.com/mobilesiteos to see our software "demo" site and https://github.com/OpenSiteMobile/mobilesiteos to view our MobileSiteOS working files.

Also, you should note that the base files are referenced by the "mobilesiteos" folder in index.html and debug.html. This was done for convenience here (https://github.com/OpenSiteMobile/OpenSiteMobile.github.io) and should not be considered a required installation practice. However, is does illustrate using MobileSiteOS in folders other than the root of a website.
