OpenSiteMobile
==============

Featuring our MobileSiteOS JavaScript mobile website layer.

This repository contains the files served by GitHub for our website https://opensitemobile.github.io. It of coarse does use our MobileSiteOS software. So please refer to https://opensitemobile.github.io/mobilesiteos to see our "demo" site and https://github.com/OpenSiteMobile/mobilesiteos to view the files.

Also, you should note that the base files are referenced by the "mobilesiteos" folder in index.html and debug.html. This was done for convenience here (https://github.com/OpenSiteMobile/OpenSiteMobile.github.io) and should not be considered a required installation practice. However is does illustrate using MobileSiteOS in folders other than the root of a website.
